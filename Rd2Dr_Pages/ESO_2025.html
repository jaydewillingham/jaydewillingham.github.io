									<p>
										In the middle of 2025 (June to August) I had the incredible opportunity to take part in the 7th ESO Summer Research Programme in Garching, Germany. I applied for the programme back in January, encouraged by my supervisors at the time, but I honestly did not expect to be selected. Coming from Australia, I thought my chances would be lower than those of applicants from ESO’s European partner countries. When I received the acceptance email I was genuinely surprised and absolutely thrilled.									</p>
									<p>
										The programme ran for six weeks and during that time we worked full time on our research projects with our supervisors. It was not just about research though, because ESO had an amazing calendar of events and activities each week. We attended twelve lectures and workshops on a wide range of astronomical topics, which really helped broaden my horizons and gave me confidence to talk with people working in adjacent fields.									</p>
									<p>
										There were usually three or more seminars happening every day across the ESO and neighbouring Max Planck Institute campuses. We were free to attend as many as we liked, and I loved being immersed in so many different research areas. There were also informal discussions, group chats and coffee talks throughout the week. Everything wrapped up with the legendary Beer Friday, where everyone came together to unwind. The atmosphere at ESO was unlike anywhere I have been. It was warm, enthusiastic and buzzing with ideas, which made it a genuinely motivating space to work in.									</p>
									<p> 
										One of the highlights for me was taking part in the weekly journal club held in ESO’s large conference theatre. Each week two students presented recent research papers to the group. One week I presented on “Growth of black holes at the centre of early-type galaxies in MOND” by Eappen and Kroupa. I created an annotated version of the paper to accompany my talk, which was a fun new challenge. The feedback I received was amazing. People commented on how clear and concise my presentation was, which was such a confidence boost. </p>

								One of the highlights of the programme was having three nights of observation time on the NTT in Chile. We were the last group to use the current instrumentation before it was shut down for upgrades. Our observations targeted supernovae, unusual star-forming regions on the outskirts of galaxies, and included some galaxy imaging.

							<h3>My Project</h3>
							<p>
								My project was titled “Exploring the Growth of Dense Stellar Systems Across Cosmic History” and was supervised by Martyna Chruslinska and Mirko Curti. The aim of the project was to understand the mechanisms behind stellar cluster formation and evolution. I worked on incorporating key equations that describe these processes into an existing semi-empirical galaxy model. By doing this, we were able to explore how much stellar mass and star formation these clusters contributed to the overall star formation history of the universe.
							</p>
							<p>
								I absolutely loved this project. At first, I was a little intimidated by modelling and computational astronomy, which was actually one of the reasons I chose this topic as my preference. I really wanted to push myself to learn and gain confidence in this area. By the end of the programme I had not only learned a lot but had also discovered that I genuinely enjoy modelling. I now hope to work more in this area in the future.
							</p>
							<p>
								The experience was incredibly rewarding. It gave me the chance to be involved in cutting-edge research and to develop more independence as a researcher, which is such a valuable skill. It was also exciting to see my work make a real contribution. Some of the plots I helped to generate were shown at a conference only a week after the programme concluded.
							</p>
							<p>
								As part of the project, I presented my findings at the closing conference for the programme, and the presentation went really well. It was a great way to round off an amazing research experience.

							<h3>Exploring Germany & Beyond</h3>
							<p>
								Getting to Germany from Australia took over 24 hours, so I was determined to make the most of my time there. While balancing research and social activities was a challenge, I managed to explore Munich and its surrounds, enjoying vibrant greenery, scenic lakes, and delicious food (kaesespaetzle became a favourite!).

								I made good use of overnight Flixbus services to explore further. A weekend in Vienna, my first full solo travel experience, was magical, enhanced by a Vienna by BillymJoel soundtrack. A quick trip to Zurich to visit a friend offered a modern yet timeless cityscape and excellent public transport (and, controversially, I preferred Swiss beer to German!).

						<section>
							<h3>FAQ</h3>

							<h4>What was the application process like?</h4>
							<p>
								It involved a cover letter, a research motivation letter, and an interview if shortlisted. The interview itself was friendly and low-stress.
							</p>

							<h4>Did you need to learn German?</h4>
							<p>
								Not really! Everyone at ESO spoke English. I used a few basic phrases for politeness in shops and restaurants, and occasionally Google Translate for groceries, but otherwise English was fine.
							</p>

							<h4>Did you have to pay for the programme?</h4>
							<p>
								No — flights and accommodation were covered by ESO. As a studentship, we weren’t paid, but we received a small stipend to cover daily expenses.
