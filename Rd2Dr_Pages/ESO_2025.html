							<h3>The Programme</h3>

									<p>
										In June–August 2025, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the 7th ESO Summer Research Programme in Garching, Germany. I applied earlier that January, encouraged by my supervisors, but honestly didn’t expect to be selected — especially as an Australian applicant among many from ESO’s partner countries!
									</p>
									<p>
										Over six weeks, we worked full-time on our projects while immersing ourselves in ESO’s vibrant research environment. Each week included 12 lectures and workshops across different areas of astronomy, which broadened my perspective enormously. With daily seminars across ESO and the Max Planck Institutes, informal chats, coffee discussions, and “Beer Fridays,” the atmosphere was both welcoming and intellectually electric.
									</p>
									<p>
										I also participated in ESO’s weekly journal club, giving a short talk on “Growth of black holes at the centre of early-type galaxies in MOND” (Eappen & Kroupa, 2025). The feedback I received on my clarity and conciseness was invaluable, and I even produced an annotated version of the paper for my presentation.

							<h3>Observation Nights at the NTT</h3>
							<p>
								One of the highlights of the programme was having three nights of observation time on the NTT in Chile. We were the last group to use the current instrumentation before it was shut down for upgrades. Our observations targeted supernovae, unusual star-forming regions on the outskirts of galaxies, and included some galaxy imaging.

							<h3>My Project</h3>
							<p>
								My research project, <i>“Exploring the Growth of Dense Stellar Systems Across Cosmic History”</i>, was supervised by Martyna Chruslinska and Mirko Curti. The goal was to understand how stellar clusters form and evolve, then integrate those mechanisms into an existing semi-empirical galaxy model to study their contribution to the cosmic star formation history.
							</p>
							<p>
								Initially, I was nervous about modelling and computational work, which is exactly why I chose this project. Over time, I grew to love it. My contributions were even used in conference presentations shortly after the programme concluded. The experience built both my technical skills and confidence in conducting independent research.

						<!-- Exploring Germany -->
						<section>
							<h3>Exploring Germany & Beyond</h3>
							<p>
								Getting to Germany from Australia took over 24 hours, so I was determined to make the most of my time there. While balancing research and social activities was a challenge, I managed to explore Munich and its surrounds, enjoying vibrant greenery, scenic lakes, and delicious food (kaesespaetzle became a favourite!).

								</div>
							</div>

							<p>
								I made good use of overnight Flixbus services to explore further. A weekend in Vienna, my first full solo travel experience, was magical, enhanced by a Vienna by BillymJoel soundtrack. A quick trip to Zurich to visit a friend offered a modern yet timeless cityscape and excellent public transport (and, controversially, I preferred Swiss beer to German!).

						<!-- FAQ -->
						<section>
							<h3>FAQ</h3>

							<h4>What was the application process like?</h4>
							<p>
								It involved a cover letter, a research motivation letter, and an interview if shortlisted. The interview itself was friendly and low-stress.
							</p>

							<h4>Did you need to learn German?</h4>
							<p>
								Not really! Everyone at ESO spoke English. I used a few basic phrases for politeness in shops and restaurants, and occasionally Google Translate for groceries, but otherwise English was fine.
							</p>

							<h4>Did you have to pay for the programme?</h4>
							<p>
								No — flights and accommodation were covered by ESO. As a studentship, we weren’t paid, but we received a small stipend to cover daily expenses.
